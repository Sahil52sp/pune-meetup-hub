Intro and Welcome

10:30 AM - 11:00 AM
Behind the Dashboard: How to Select Prometheus Exporters Wisely
Behind every great dashboard is the right Prometheus exporter. Choosing the wrong exporter can lead to noisy metrics, missing signals, or unnecessary complexity.
In this session, I will walk through the different types of Prometheus exporters ‚Äî official, vendor-specific, community-driven, and custom-built. I‚Äôll explain the trade-offs, how to evaluate them, and common pitfalls. The talk will also include a practical demo of popular exporters (like Node Exporter, Blackbox Exporter, and a database exporter), along with a quick look at how to build a simple custom exporter.
Speaker: Kuldeep Pilaji (Observability Engineer at SailPoint)

11:10 AM - 11:40 AM

Speaker: Pankaj Dwivedi (Senior Software Engineer II at Confluent)

11:50 AM - 12:20 PM
Building Enterprise-Grade Alerting for Multi Cluster Kubernetes at Scale
When working with complex distributed systems, alerting may seem a very small portion of the monitoring infrastructure when compared to the more significant Metric ingestion and TSDB components. But what if you have to configure and manage an alerting system which has to operate hand in hand to cater multiple clusters and environments? It should be capable of accommodating numerous hundreds of checks in multiple environments of our Kubernetes Infrastructure without introducing any additional friction, even if it involves onboarding a hundred checks simultaneously.
This session covers the system design and thought process that went in implementing a modern alerting system built completely with modern and cloud native standards in mind.
Speaker: Uddhabendra Maity (DevOps SDE II at Helpshift)

12:20 PM - 12:50 PM
